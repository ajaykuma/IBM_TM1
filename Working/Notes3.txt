--Creating a Picklist for an Element of a Dimension
1. Subset
2. Attribute

9# Dimension: TDProductDim1 > will contain products > add root member : Products <consolidated>  > and add members using Products.csv file
              TDCountriesDim1 > will contain countries > add root member Countries <consolidated>: and add members using Countries0.csv file
              TDSampleMeasuresDim1 > Quantity (numeric),Months Introduced (string)


use file Quantitydata.csv and create cube TCDCube2

--add a new view and check

Create a dimension (which will be our subset) > TD2023Dim1
Start year: 2023
End year: 2023
Frequency : yearly

in sets> create set > with only members selected on right ie just name of months (or remove 2023 entry)
save it as SSet1 in shared.

now add this to your attributes for TDSampleMeasuresDim1 
--create attribute Picklist <string>
at intersection of Months Introduced and Picklist > subset:TD2023Dim1:SSet1

save or refresh the book

Test in your view and it should allow you to add values only from the picklist

--we can also create a static picklist with selected options
in TDSampleMeasuresDim1 , add new member StaticChoices
for Picklist attribute > static:opt1:opt2:op3:opt4

To include a null value at the beginning or in the middle of a static pick list, use two consecutive colons in the pick list definition. For example, the code: static:value1:value2::value3:value4 results in a pick list with a null value between value2 and value3.

To include a null value at the end of a static pick list, insert a colon without a following value at the end of the pick list definition. For example, static:value1:value2::value3:value4: results in a pick list with a null value that follows value4.

testing and working with rules

--choose a view on a cube .Say this cube uses a dimension TDTimeDim11
  Click on menu next to selection (which comes from TDTimeDim11)
  select set editor..
  Right most icon shows MDX which we can use 
  it initially shows..(based on selection)
  
  DRILLDOWNMEMBER(EXCEPT(DRILLDOWNMEMBER([TDTimeDim11].[TDTimeDim11].[level000].MEMBERS , {[TDTimeDim11].[TDTimeDim11].[2023]} , RECURSIVE) , 
  {[TDTimeDim11].[TDTimeDim11].[2024]}) ,{[TDTimeDim11].[TDTimeDim11].[Q1 2023]})

  edit it
  [TDTimeDim11].[Q1 2023]

  we can commit to check the result in our selection
  we can save as - TSet1 (public) to be used later
  
  Later we can use this in Current set > selection > exiting sets > TSet1
  which shows 
  TM1SubsetToSet([TDTimeDim11].[TDTimeDim11] , "TSet1" , "public")

  --lets use inbuilt function Descendants by appending Descendants and click on commit
  DESCENDANTS(TM1SubsetToSet([TDTimeDim11].[TDTimeDim11] , "TSet1" , "public"))

  save as TSet2
  
  --change it to see all entries
  TM1SUBSETALL([TDTimeDim11])

  OR
  [TDTimeDim11].MEMBERS

--selecting using a range
  [TDTimeDim11].[Jan 2023] : [TDTimeDim11].[May 2023]
