6# For exiting Dimension TDTimeDim1 > edit Hierarchy TDTimeDim1 and members to contain 2024 (Parent) and 
add 
Q1 2024
Q2 2024
Q3 2024
Q4 2024 as child.
We can further add months too..

once done, check in view if new timelines reflect.

----------------------------
7# Creating 
Select TVDView1 (stored in shared location) > duplicate it and
now we have two copies of data.

--select 2 copy of view > exploration > line chart

in first copy of view, we see Total regions which belongs to TDSalesRepDim1 dimension.
Drag it on to the canvas.

Now we want to synchronize, ie as we select a particular sales rep it automatically changes visuals or views accordingly.
So for each widget, we can click on top right corner > properties and synchronize..

synchronization group : sheet
>save the book

-------------------------------
8# open the book and 
select the view > select both dimensions (sales and calculated_comm)
> calculation option > calculated_comm is what % of Sales > add a column
--duplicate this for new visual
--choose bar and line

click on fields option>
Time dimension is on x-axis

#for column length
choose 
Sales and % Of

on x > edit this set and since 2024 has no data ,we can collapse 2024 or remove it.
now we can view the chart.

--lets do the synchronize option too..
synchronization group : new book

-----------------------------
9# Dimension: TDProductDim1 > Products
              TDCountriesDim1 > Countries
              TDSampleMeasuresDim1 > Quantity (numeric),Months Introduced (string)

use file quantitydata nd create cube..and check

we need to create a subset (public)
TD2023Dim1 > 2023 > roles into months

now remove the level000 or create a subset using only months.

now add this to your attributes for TDSampleMeasuresDim1


subset:<dimname>:<levelname>
